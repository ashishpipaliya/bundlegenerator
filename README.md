## 🌈 Purpose
 Etsy is an E-commerce platform where we can sell digital goods. Quotes bundle is trending product on Etsy. In order to create such product, we have two options
- Hire <strong>Graphic Designer</strong> to create images
- We can create ourself using tool like canva or photoshop.

Second option was suitable for me but in canva, I can't generate bulk images like 500 or 1000 images in single click.

So I created this bulk image generator and named it `Mini Canva`
____
## 🔥 Tech Stack
- Flutter

- State Management 
    - Provider
____
## ✨ Usage
- Write quotes, separated by new line like this.

```
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started
I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed
Don't limit yourself. Many people limit themselves to what they think they can do. You can go as far as your mind lets you. What you believe, remember, you can achieve
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.
It's hard to beat a person who never gives up
I wake up every morning and think to myself, 'how far can I push this company in the next 24 hours.'
If people are doubting how far you can go, go so far that you can’t hear them anymore
We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes – understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success.
